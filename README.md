# SEO Pro Stack

Curated plugins, themes, hosting and workflow tools for WordPress, plus a few small quality-of-life features.

Version: {SEOPROSTACK_VERSION}

## Where to find it

Go to **Settings → SEO Pro Stack**. The screen has three groups of tabs:

- **Settings**: General and Workflow. Changes save instantly; there is no Save button.
- **Discover**: Theme, Free Plugins, Pro Plugins, Hosting and Tools.
- **About**: this Read Me.

## Features

### Modern admin colours (General)

Uses the WordPress “Modern” admin colour scheme for every user while enabled. Switching it also updates your own profile: on selects Modern, off selects the WordPress default. Other users’ saved choices are not changed and return when the setting is off.

### Magic login links (General)

Adds “Email me a login link” to the login screen, next to “Lost your password?”.

- The link works once and expires after 5–60 minutes (10 by default). Requesting a new link cancels the previous one.
- Opening the link shows a **Log in** button; the login happens when it is pressed. Email security scanners that open links therefore cannot use them up.
- The response is the same whether or not the account exists, and requests are rate limited per IP address and per user.
- Links are stored only as a keyed hash and are removed when used, when they expire, and on uninstall.
- Passwords keep working. Administrators can be required to use their password.
- Uses the core login screen and core `wp_login` / `login_redirect` hooks, so activity logs, redirect rules and two-factor plugins that use `wp_login` still apply. Two-factor plugins that only check the password step are not asked; on those sites exclude administrators or leave the feature off.

### Publishing queue (Workflow)

Publishing a post from the editor without choosing a date schedules it for the next free time slot instead.

- Slots are times of day (for example `09:00, 15:00`) on the days you choose, in the site timezone. Each slot takes one post.
- Dates you choose yourself (future or past), updates to posts that are already published or scheduled, and saves from imports, WP-CLI, cron, XML-RPC or API clients are left alone.
- Queued posts are normal “Scheduled” posts and WordPress publishes them. Turning the feature off leaves them scheduled.
- Choose which content types use the queue.

### iFrame block (Workflow)

Adds an **iFrame** block to the editor (Embed category).

- Width and height, or an aspect ratio (16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16…).
- Lazy loading, full screen, border.
- Sandbox with per-permission checkboxes (on by default), permissions policy (camera, microphone, autoplay, payment…) and referrer policy.
- Optionally pass the page’s URL parameters (such as UTM tags) to the embedded page.
- Allowed domains: limit which sites can be embedded (subdomains included).
- Who can add iFrames: contributors, authors, editors, or only users who can add any HTML. Checked in the editor and again when the page is shown, using the post author’s role.
- Output is built on the server from validated settings, so stored content cannot inject HTML. Turning the feature off hides existing iFrame blocks.

### Copy linked images to Media Library (Workflow)

When a post is saved, images linked from other sites are copied into the Media Library, resized, attached to the post, and the content is changed to serve the local copy.

- Works with the block editor, the classic editor and programmatic saves by users who can upload files.
- Images already imported from the same address are reused instead of uploaded again.
- Optional maximum width and height: larger images are scaled down before upload.
- Excluded domains (and their subdomains) are left alone. Your own site is always excluded.
- File name and alt text patterns support tokens such as `%filename%`, `%post_title%` and `%date%`. Existing alt text is kept.
- Up to 10 images are imported per save; the rest are imported on the next save.

### Discover

- **Theme**: install, activate or customise the Kadence theme.
- **Free Plugins**: recommended plugins from WordPress.org by category, with the same Install and Activate buttons as Plugins → Add New. Shown only to users who can install plugins (on multisite, super admins).
- **Pro Plugins, Hosting, Tools**: filterable directories with links to each product. Pro plugins show a badge when their free version is already on the site.

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.2 or later
- PHP 7.4 or later

## Extending

Developers can add settings, tabs and directory entries with filters:

- `seoprostack_features`: register a feature class that extends `SEOProStack_Feature` (declare settings in `settings()`, add hooks in `boot()`).
- `seoprostack_settings_schema`: add or change settings. Each entry sets `type` (bool, int, text, domains, select, multi or times), `default`, `label`, `description` and either `tab` or `parent`; select and multi also take `options` (an array or a callable). Settings render and save automatically.
- `seoprostack_admin_tabs`: add or reorder admin tabs. Each tab sets `label`, `group` (settings, discover or about), a `render` callback and an optional `capability`; tabs the current user lacks the capability for are hidden.
- `seoprostack_pro_items`, `seoprostack_hosting_items`, `seoprostack_tools_items`: change directory entries.
- `seoprostack_auto_upload_process_post`: skip image copying for specific posts.
- `seoprostack_auto_upload_limit`: change the per-save import limit.
- `seoprostack_magic_login_allowed`: allow or refuse login links for a user.
- `seoprostack_magic_login_email`: change the login link email.
- `seoprostack_magic_login_ip_limit`: requests allowed per IP address per 15 minutes (default 5).
- `seoprostack_post_scheduler_applies`: skip the publishing queue for specific posts.

Actions:

- `seoprostack_setting_saved`: a setting was saved from the admin screen.
- `seoprostack_magic_login_link_sent`: a login link was emailed.
- `seoprostack_post_queued`: a post was scheduled by the publishing queue.
- `seoprostack_image_imported`: an external image was imported.
- `seoprostack_image_upload_error`: an image could not be imported.

Read a setting with `SEOProStack_Settings::get( 'key' )`.

## Uninstall

Deleting the plugin removes its settings and cached data. Imported media stays in the Media Library because your posts use it.

## Changelog
